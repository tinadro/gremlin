hhblits1 plots: 
Sequences per length for each position, BEFORE the coverage/gap filter was applied
Legend: Dots above the red line, indicates positions where there is > 5 sequences per length (if visible, green bar = 20 seq/len). Point of this graphic is to give you an idea if resubmitting a sub-portion of your sequence might help increase the overall Seq/Len

hhblits2 plots:
Sequences per length for each position, AFTER the coverage/gap filter was applied
Legend: If visible, the positions blocked in grey are regions that have > 75% gaps and were automatically trimmed and excluded in the GREMLIN analysis
